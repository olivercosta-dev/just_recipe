# Just Recipe!
Just Recipe is a project that I built from the ground up.

Backend built in Rust, with the help of Axum, in the form of a REST API.
Front-end built using SolidJS.
DB: Postgres

Features:
- Add/Modify/Delete ingredients (eg.: carrots, apples etc.)
- Add/Modify/Delete unit types (eg.: kilogram, ounce etc.)
- Add/Modify/Delete recipes

Please note that *for now* I have finished working on this project, as this was a way for me to learn Axum, and SolidJS.
I may continue to work on it at some time.
